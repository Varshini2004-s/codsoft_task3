I developed a simple calculator using HTML, CSS and Java Script as a part of the web development internship at codsoft. In this task i have created a simple calculator which performs the basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The key feature is that this calculator shows you the calculation history which means it will have a history of all the operations you have performed.
